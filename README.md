A jupyter notebook containing a CNN model for object detection

### To Do:
- ~~Gather images for dataset~~  
- ~~Load and preprocess the dataset~~ 
- ~~Build the CNN model~~
- ~~Train the model~~
- ~~Evaluate the model~~
- ~~Save LabelEncoder in model code and use for prediction~~
- ~~Make predictions~~

### How To Use:
1. run main.ipynb
2. open predict.py
3. replace existing path to image with desired image
4. run predict.py
Ta Daah~

(need to improve accuracy)

#### Goals:
Identify as many as you can of these items or letters explicitly in any image provided </br>
Make it easy to supply in new images and report visible objects from the list </br>
(Determine the number of each of these items in a picture) </br>
(Identify other items outside of the list)

#### Objects:
Laptop | Monitor | Keyboard | Mouse | Football | Ball (Soccer Ball) | Bee | Train | Letter M | Letter T
